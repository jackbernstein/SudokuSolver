# SudokuSolver
A java program that takes an input of 81 numbers that resemble the starting position of a Sudoku puzzle. The program then generates a tree data structure with all legal possibilities from the original board. The program then performs a DFS and prints to console the correct board to the puzzle. 

The program does not check if the starting board cannot be completed, but it does check to make sure that 81 numbers were input.
